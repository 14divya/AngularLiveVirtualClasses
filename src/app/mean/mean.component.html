    <h1>MEAN</h1>
    <p>A relatively new stack, MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. MEAN is an end-to-end
        JavaScript stack largely used for cloud-ready applications. Understanding why you might use it, identifying
        examples of when to employ it, and diving deeper into the individual components can help you maximize the value
        of MEAN for software development.

    <h3>Benefits of MEAN Stack</h3>
    <p>When building an application from scratch, employing a consistent, standardized software stack is vital. Creating
        your backend with a set of tools designed to work together reduces development time and streamlines resources.
        However, the stack field is getting crowded. From LAMP to Ruby on Rails, there are a number of options. Each
        stack has its benefits and downsides and is geared for different projects. There's no one-size-fits-all stack
        for development. MEAN is an open source web stack that is mainly used to create cloud-hosted applications. MEAN
        stack applications are flexible, scalable, and extensible, making them the perfect candidate for cloud hosting.
        The stack includes its own web server so it can be deployed easily, and the database can be scaled on demand to
        accommodate temporary usage spikes. A MEAN application enters the world optimized to take advantage of all the
        cost savings and performance improvements of the cloud. JavaScript has long been a popular language for
        front-end web developmentâ€”it's flexible, dynamic, and easy to use. But it has been an option only for backend
        and database development for a few years, allowing developers to create applications using end-to-end
        JavaScript. Because every part of MEAN uses the same language, you can streamline your development teams. MEAN
        removes the need to hire different specialists to develop each part of an application. Instead, you can use a
        single pool of JavaScript developers to work adaptively, where and when needed. Standardizing on JavaScript also
        provides an opportunity to reuse code across the entire application, reducing unnecessary reinvention.
